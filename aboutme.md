Hi there! My name is Angelina Volkova. I am a PhD Candidate at NYU Medical Center in Systems and Computational Biomedicine training program researching the human microbiome in autoimmune diseases with machine learning and deep learning approaches. The world of microbiome fascinates me since it has a tremendous influence on our health. This field is relatively new and  most of the key discoveries are yet to be made.
